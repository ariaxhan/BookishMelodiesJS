## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Import required libraries
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataJson <- fromJSON("/Users/ariahan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BookishMelodiesJS/r/testdata.json")
print(dataJson)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
