I faced a lot of difficulty in using the Spotify API. 
Originally I intended to use the OpenLibrary API as well, but I kept running into errors, so I simplified it.
The app continues to have issues working on Firefox but functions through Google Chrome.
I got help from my friend to finish up the Spotify connectiion.
Further information in my FAQ page.
