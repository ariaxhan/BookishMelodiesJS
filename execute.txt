how to execute:

1. cd to client directory
2. run "npm run build"
3. cd to server directory
4. run "node server.js"
5. open browser and go to "localhost:3001/home"

note: I was not able to put everything in the public folder,
so it is in the src folder.
The React app would not build if I put it in the public folder.
The port number is 3001.
The site runs CORS issues when opened through Firefox,
but works through Google Chrome. I could not figure out how to make 
it work for Firefox as well, please test on Chrome
